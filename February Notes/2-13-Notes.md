###### Scrum Methodology
SCRUM is a process in agile methodology which is a combination of the Iterative model and the incremental model.
One of the major handicaps of the traditional Waterfall model was that – until the first phase is complete, the application does not move to the other phase. And by chance, if there are some changes in the later stage of the cycle, then it becomes very challenging to implement those changes, as it would involve revisiting the earlier phases and redoing the changes.

##### Some of the key characteristics of SCRUM include:
- Self-organized and focused team.
- No huge requirement documents, rather have a very precise and to the point stories.
- The cross-functional teams work together as a single unit.
- Close communication with the user representative to understand the features.
- Has a definite timeline of maximum one month.
- Instead of doing the entire “thing” at a time, Scrum does a little of everything at a given interval.
- Resources capability and availability are considered before committing anything.

##### How To Deliver High Value Software Features In A Short Time Period Using Agile Scrum Process

Scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for projects, products and application development. Scrum has become a more and more popular software development and testing framework among organizations.

Many small to large-sized IT companies have embraced the Scrum framework as this creates excellent quality products in less time than other traditional methodologies like waterfall processes.

#####  Soft Skills for the Scrum Team
When we start our regular (Agile) sprints (Cycles of work), we usually find some of the challenges with our team members. These challenges are not part of the technical difficulties. It usually occurs with the team member’s mindset or their soft skills.

Many successful Scrum projects have taught us that the success of a scrum depends on how team members are supported wholeheartedly towards Sprint.

Cross-functional teamwork is at the heart of Scrum.  There is no “my work”, “I have finished my work” and “your work”. In a Scrum team, we find people saying things like only “Our work”, “we have completed our Sprint”.

##### Communication
Good communication must exist among the team members of the development team, testing team, business analysts and stakeholders. There must be a highly collaborative interaction between the client and the delivery teams.More client involvement implies more suggestions or changes from the client.  It implies more bandwidth for communication.

##### Commitment

Agile Teams need periodic re-energization to renew their commitments to their purpose and to each other.  Scrum Masters can help by ensuring that the team embraces the concept of whole-team responsibility and whole-team commitment to deliver working software at the end of each sprint.

With the whole team commitment, the team member who has completed his tasks will help the one who has not yet completed so that hopefully each team finishes the assigned tasks on time.

##### Problem Solving
Scrum does not simply focus on developing just any type of end product.  Instead, the Scrum method allows the team to focus on creating a product that fulfills the customer’s highest value priorities which are defined by product owners.

##### Transparency
Transparency or openness among team members and management gives a real momentum to the scrum team.

Scrum Master encourages people to ask for help, surface roadblocks, and give recognition to those who help others and solve problems. At the same time, Scrum Master also understands the time wasted and the impact on the team when individuals sit ideally or ignore problems.

##### Scrum Result
If the Scrum team follows the above said soft skills, the team velocity will tend to increase significantly.  In turn, customers will appreciate the results or updates and also can react quickly to any potential problems.


#### Important SCRUM Terminologies
##### 1. Scrum Team
The scrum team is a team comprising of 7 with + or – two members. These members are a mixture of competencies and comprise of developers, testers, database people, support people etc. along with the product owner and a scrum master.

##### 2. Sprint
Sprint is a predefined interval or time frame in which the work has to be completed and make it ready for review or ready for production deployment. This time box usually lies between 2 weeks to 1 month. In our day to day life when we say that we follow 1-month Sprint cycle, it simply means that we work for one month on the tasks and make it ready for review by the end of that month.

##### 3. Product Owner
The product owner is the key stakeholder or the lead user of the application to be developed. The product owner is the person who represents the customer side. He/she has the final authority and should always be available for the team.

##### 4. Scrum Master
Is the facilitator of the scrum team. He/she makes sure that the scrum team is productive and progressive. In case of any impediments, scrum master follows up and resolves them for the team. SCRUM Master is the mediator between the PO and the team.

##### 5. Business Analyst 
A Business Analyst plays a very important role in SCRUM. This person is responsible for getting the requirement finalized and drafted in the requirement docs (based on which the user stories are created).

##### 6. User Story
In the scrum, we don’t have those huge requirements documents, rather the requirements are defined in a single paragraph, typically having the format as:
As a <User / type of user>
I want to <Some achievable goal/target>
To achieve <some result or reason for doing the thing>

##### 7. Epics
Epics are equivocal user stories or we can say that these are the user stories which are not defined and are kept for future sprints.

##### 8. Product Backlog
The product backlog is a kind of bucket or source where all the user stories are kept. This is maintained by the Product Owner. The product backlog can be imagined as a wishlist of the product owner who prioritizes it as per the business needs.

##### 9. Sprint Backlog
Based on the priority, user stories are taken from the Product Backlog as one at a time. The Scrum team brainstorms on it determines the feasibility and decides on the stories to work on a particular sprint. The collective list of all the user stories which the scrum team works on a particular sprint is known as Sprint backlog.

##### 10. Story Points
Story points are a quantitative indication of the complexity of a user story. Based on the story point, estimation and efforts for a story are determined.

##### 11. Burn down chart
Burn down chart is a graph which shows the estimated v/s actual effort of the scrum tasks.It is a tracking mechanism by which for a particular sprint the day to day tasks are tracked to check whether the stories are progressing towards the completion of the committed story points or not.

##### 12. Velocity

The total number of story point which a scrum team archives in a sprint, is called Velocity. The Scrum team is judged or referenced by its velocity. Having said that, it should be kept in mind that the objective here is NOT achieving the maximum story points, but to have a quality deliverable, respecting the scrum team’s comfort level.

#### Activities Done in SCRUM Methodology
##### 1.  Planning Meeting
A planning meeting is the starting point of Sprint. It is the meeting where the entire scrum team gathers, the SCRUM Master selects a user story based on the priority from the product backlog and the team brainstorms on it.

##### 2.  Execution of Sprint Tasks
As the name suggests, these are the actual work done by the scrum team to accomplish their task and take the user story into the “Done” state.

##### 3. Daily Standup
During the sprint cycle, every day the scrum team meets for, not more than 15 minutes (could be a stand-up call, recommended to have during the beginning of the day) and state 3 points:

What did the team member do yesterday?
What did the team member plan to do today?
Any impediments (roadblocks)?

##### 4. Review Meeting
At the end of every sprint cycle, the SCRUM team meets again and demonstrates the implemented user stories to the product owner. The product owner may cross verify the stories as per its acceptance criteria. It’s again the responsibility of the Scrum master to preside over this meeting.

##### 5.Retrospective Meeting
The retrospective meeting happens after the review meeting.
