#### What  is Agile?
**Agile** is not a set of rules. Agile is not a set of guidelines. Agile is not even a methodology. Rather, Agile is a set of principles that encourage flexibility, adaptability, communication and working software over plans and processes. It is very succinctly captured in what is called the agile manifesto.

Agile software development allows the team to work together more efficiently and effectively in developing complex projects. It consists of practices that exercise iterative and incremental techniques which are easily adopted and display great results.

##### However, the most popular methodologies amongst all of them are:

- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming

#### Agile Methodology


###### Advantages of Agile Methodology
1. The customers continuously get a look and feel of the project progress at the end of each iteration/sprint.
2. Each sprint provides the customer with a working software which meets their expectations as per the definition of done provided by them.
3. The development teams are quite responsive to the changing requirements and can accommodate changes even in the advanced stages of development.
4. There is constant two-way communication which keeps the customers involved, thus all stakeholders – business and technical – have clear visibility on the project’s progress.
5. The design of the product is efficient and fulfills the business requirements.


###### Disadvantages of Agile Methodology
1.  Comprehensive documentation is not preferred which can lead to agile teams incorrectly interpreting this as agile doesn’t require documentation. So the rigor gets lost on documentation. This should be avoided by continuously asking yourself if this is sufficient information to proceed or not.
2.  Sometimes, at the beginning of the projects, the requirements are not crystal clear. The teams might proceed and find that the customers’ vision got realigned and in such situations, the teams need to incorporate many changes and it is difficult to gauge the end result as well.
   
#### Types of Agile Methodologies

##### Scrum
Scrum can easily be considered to be the most popular agile framework. The term ‘scrum’ is much considered synonymously to ‘agile’ by most practitioners. But that is a misconception. Scrum is just one of the frameworks by which you can implement agile.

##### The 3-3-5 framework.

1. Roles: PO, Scrum master, and development team.
2. Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog and Product increment.
3. Events: Sprint, Sprint planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint review and Sprint retrospective.

##### Kanban
These cards contain details of the work to be done on the software. The purpose is visualization. Every team member is aware of the work to be done through these visual aids.

 ##### Lean
In lean, you divide a process into value-adding activities, non-value adding activities and essential non-value adding activities. Any activity which can be classified as a non-value adding activity is a waste and we should try to remove that wastage in the process to make it leaner.

Lean software development can be used in any IT project by applying the seven lean principles which are shown below:

##### Extreme Programming (XP)
Extreme programming is another most popular agile techniques. As per extremeprogramming.org, the first XP project was started on March 6, 1996. They also mention that XP impacts software project development in 5 different ways – communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage. These are called the values of XP.
