The Design of Everyday Things - by Don Norman

 The book is about the design of products and everyday objects, and how they can be made more user-friendly and easy to use. The book covers the principles of human-centered design and the psychology of everyday objects and actions. It provides a framework for understanding the design of things in the world around us and how they can be made more intuitive and efficient. The book is considered a classic in the field of design and user experience, and is widely used as a textbook in design and human-computer interaction courses.

It is intended to help designers, engineers, and anyone involved in creating products and objects to think about the needs of the user in the design process. The overall thought of the book is to show how good design can enhance the interaction between people and their environment and how poor design can lead to frustration and inconvenience.
